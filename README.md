# 🔐 Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based solution to detect and classify network intrusions using supervised learning algorithms. This project is built using Python, trained on a labeled dataset, and deployed using IBM Watsonx.ai for real-time intrusion detection.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems struggle to identify evolving cyber threats. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting various types of cyber-attacks—such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R—based on network traffic patterns.
